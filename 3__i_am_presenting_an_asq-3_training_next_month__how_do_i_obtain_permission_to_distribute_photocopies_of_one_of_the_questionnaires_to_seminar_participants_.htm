<p><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 16px;">If you are presenting an ASQ-3 seminar, Brookes Publishing grants you permission to distribute photocopies of the completed 48-month ASQ-3 questionnaire that is posted online at www.agesandstages.com, free of charge. <br />
<br />
Your seminar cannot generate revenue for any program or individual. If you would like to use a different questionnaire in your seminar, or if your seminar is generating revenue for any program or individual, please complete the Permission Request Form online at www.brookespublishing.com. Please note that permission will be granted for one-time use only, and there will be a processing fee. Please also note that our standard processing time is 4-6 weeks. If you are submitting a rush request, there may be an additional charge.&nbsp;<br />
