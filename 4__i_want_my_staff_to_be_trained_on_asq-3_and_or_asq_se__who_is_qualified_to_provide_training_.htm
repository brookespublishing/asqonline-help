<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The authors of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2, and their colleagues, offer great seminars on these screening tools. To learn more about these seminars, please visit www.brookesonlocation.com.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, many other individuals have attended an ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 Training of Trainers Seminar, and can teach your staff about these instruments. A well-qualified trainer will have been working in the early childhood field for at least 5 years, and using ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 at least once a week for 2 years or more. A well-qualified trainer will also have attended an official ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 Training of Trainers seminar offered by Brookes Publishing&rsquo;s Professional Development program, Brookes On Location.</span></p>
