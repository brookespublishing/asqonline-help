<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">A site is a single physical location, such as an office. An organization may have various sites--for example, the downtown office, the East branch, and the North branch. The&nbsp;sites may be located in the same city or town, the same county, the same state, or even different states. <br />
<br />
For instance, the University of Michigan has three campuses in Michigan: Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn. Each campus is a different site; the main campus in Ann Arbor cannot purchase ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 and then share copies of it with the two branch campuses in other cities. <br />
<br />
Even on one campus, there can be different sites; say, if the School of Social Work wanted to use ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2, and the School of Education also wanted to use ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2, they each must purchase their own ASQ-3 box and ASQ:SE-2 box, as they are separate departments located in different buildings. <br />
<br />
Head Start programs are another example: Even though there are dozens of Head Start programs across the United States, and they&rsquo;re all part of the same organization, the main office cannot purchase one ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 box to share with all of the sites; each office must own an original ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 box and their corresponding <em>User&rsquo;s Guides</em>.<br />
<br />
Some ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 users are pediatricians with more than one office in the same town; each office must own an original ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 box and their corresponding <em>User&rsquo;s Guides</em>, rather than sharing the ASQ-3/ASQ:SE-2 materials between the multiple offices in the same town.&nbsp;</span></p>
