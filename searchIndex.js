As a Provider, you are using Family Access to solicit screenings from children who are already a part of your program and to whom you are assigned. For this reason, you don&rsquo;t want anyone outside of your program using your Family Access landing page to enter screenings. To ensure that only caregivers whose children are a part of your program have access to your Family Access landing page, you can provide them with a passcode that must be entered in order for them to access the questionnaires. If you choose to provide a passcode, your Family Access landing page will have an additional field that prompts the caregiver to enter the passcode before continuing. See also 2.

First, it will automatically complete the task associated with that packet. Second, it will allow you to download the packet as a PDF file, so that you can print and mail it to the caregiver. To generate a packet: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Click the View/Print Packets Quick Link. Locate the packet you would like to generate and click the Generate link. Locate the child for whom you would like to generate this packet and click the Download link. When the packet has finished generating, click the Download File link. You can then open the PDF file or save it to your computer. When you click the Generate link next to a packet, you will be taken to a page where you select the child or children for whom you would like to generate this packet. You will see four tabs and multiple search fields to assist you in quickly and easily locating the children for whom you are generating the packet. The four tabs are: Screenings Due, Tasks Due, Child Profiles, and Completed Screenings. Once a packet has been generated and downloaded it will be available for a limited time under Recent Bulk Prints via the Quick Links in Screening Management. 10.5.4.1 Generating via the Screenings Due Tab The Screenings Due tab will list all screening tasks that are scheduled to be sent out to caregivers. Once you generate the packet for a child listed under Screenings Due, that task will move to Screening Tasks Completed (a screening task is completed when the packet has been generated). The Screenings Due list includes the due date, the child name, the child DOB, responsible Provider, questionnaire, type, previous questionnaire, and previous result. You can easily search through the list of screenings due and narrow it down by using the Search field at the top of the page. You can search by due date, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, Provider name, type, questionnaire, previous questionnaire, and previous result. To search, begin typing what you are searching for in the corresponding text field and ASQ Online will automatically pull up any results matching your search. When you have located the child for whom you would like to generate this packet, click the Download link to the right of the child&rsquo;s name. The file will run and then a Download File link will appear. Click this link and a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open or save this PDF file. Once you download the packet and refresh the page, ASQ Online will update the Screenings Due list &ndash; the child you have generated the packet for will no longer be listed under Screenings Due. This will help you keep track of which children you still need to generate screening packets for. 10.5.4.2 Generating via the Tasks Due Tab The Tasks Due tab will list all non-screening tasks that are due for completion. Once you generate a packet for a child listed under the Tasks Due tab, the task will move to Tasks Completed (a task is completed when the corresponding packet has been generated). The Tasks Due list includes the due date, the child name, the child DOB, the responsible Provider, the task type, the previous questionnaire, and the previous result. You can easily search through the list of tasks due and narrow it down by using the Search field at the top of the page. You can search by due date, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, Provider name, task type, previous questionnaire, and previous result. To search, begin typing what you are searching for in the corresponding text field and ASQ Online will automatically pull up any results matching your search. When you have located the child for whom you would like to generate this packet, click the Download link to the right of the child&rsquo;s name. The file will run and then a Download File link will appear. Click this link and a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open or save this PDF file. If you are generating a packet that includes screening documents, you have the option to customize the interval. If the packet includes screening documents (such as a questionnaire), you will see a Customize link to the right of the child. Clicking this link will pull up a pop-up box, which includes the recommended interval. If you would like to use the recommended interval in order to generate a blank questionnaire for the next screening for the child, click the Use Interval button. If you would like to generate the packet with a screening that has already been completed for the child, you can select the interval (including the date the child was screened) from the &ldquo;Completed Screening&rdquo; drop-down menu, and click the Use Screening button. The packet will then generate with the completed screening for that child. Once you download the packet and refresh the page, ASQ Online will update the Tasks Due list &ndash; the child you have generated the packet for will no longer be listed under Tasks Due. This will help you keep track of which children you still need to generate task packets for. 10.5.4.3 Generating via the Child Profiles Tab The Child Profiles tab will list all of the Child Profiles in your program. This tab will allow you to generate a packet for a child in your program who doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have a screening or non-screening task scheduled for completion. The Child Profiles tab lists the child name, the child DOB, the previous questionnaire, the previous result of that questionnaire, and the date the questionnaire was last sent. You can search for specific children by date last sent, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, previous questionnaire, and previous result. You can also choose to search for only those children that have not had materials sent to them. If you are generating a packet that includes screening documents, you have the option to customize the interval. If the packet includes screening documents (such as a questionnaire), you will see a Customize link to the right of the child. Clicking this link will pull up a pop-up box, which includes the recommended interval. If you would like to use the recommended interval in order to generate a blank questionnaire for this child&rsquo;s screening, click the Use Interval button. If you would like to generate the packet with a different screening interval, you can select that interval from the drop-down menu and click the Use Interval button. Once you generate the packet and download the file, the date in the &ldquo;Date Last Sent&rdquo; column will update with the date you generated the packet. 10.5.4.4 Generating via the Completed Screenings Tab The Completed Screenings tab will list all completed screenings in your program, regardless of whether they had associated tasks. You can use this tab to download a screening packet that includes the completed questionnaire. ( NOTE: The completed questionnaire will only be attached to a related screening packet that includes a questionnaire document.) The Completed Screenings tab lists the screening date, the child name, the child DOB, the responsible Provider, the questionnaire, the result (Above, Monitoring, or Below), and the date the materials were last sent to the caregiver. You can search for specific children by date last sent, screening date, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, Provider name, questionnaire, and result. You can also choose to search for only those children that have not had materials sent to them. Once you generate the packet and download the file, the date in the &ldquo;Date Last Sent&rdquo; column will update with the date you generated the packet. 10.5.5 View Child List If you wish to see a list of all children for whom you have generated a packet, you can click the Child List link to the right of that packet. The Child List page will show you each child for whom that packet has been generated, the child&rsquo;s date of birth, and the date the packet was generated for that child. You can also search for specific children by date generated, child DOB, child name, child ID, and child alt. ID.

These documents include the forms found in the ASQ User&rsquo;s Guides, as well as other system documents, and any program documents that the Program Administrator creates. Documents are what make up packets, but you can also download and print any document on its own, without generating a packet. There are 3 categories of documents: Screening, Follow-up, and Other. Screening documents are all documents that are associated with the screening of children. Follow-up documents are all documents intended to be used when following up on a screening with the child&rsquo;s caregiver. And Other documents are additional documents that don&rsquo;t fall into either Screening or Follow-up categories, but are still helpful to your program. Below is a table listing all of the documents provided by ASQ Online, and which category they fall under. 10.6.1 View/Print Documents The View/Print Documents page lists all the system and program documents, in alphabetical order. The documents list includes the name, description of the document (for program documents only), the questionnaire type associated with the document (if applicable), the category (Screening, Follow-up, or Other), and the document type (System or Program). Each document will also include a Download link, so that you can generate the document as a PDF file and print it or save it to your computer. Any documents that contain dynamic content will have a Download Preview link to the right of the document. Clicking this will allow you to see what the document will look like when it is generated with child, caregiver, or program information within a packet, by using fake data as an example. (For more information on dynamic content, see Section 10.6.2.1 Dynamic Content .) To access the View/Print Documents page: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Documents Quick Link. 10.6.1.1 Searching for Documents You can quickly and easily search for any document by using the Search Documents field at the top of the View/Print Documents page. You can search by the name of the document, the description of the document (for program documents only), the questionnaire type, the category, and the document type. To search for a document, begin typing in the corresponding field, or select an option from the drop-down menu, and ASQ Online will automatically pull up suggestions matching your search options. 10.6.1.2 System Documents System documents are all documents provided by the ASQ Online system, including screening and follow-up documents. To download a system document: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Documents Quick Link. Locate the system document you would like to download. (You can easily narrow down your search to only system documents by selecting &ldquo;System&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Document Type&rdquo; drop-down menu.) Click the Download link to the right of the document. A pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open the PDF file or save it to your computer. NOTE: If the document includes dynamic content, it will have a Download Preview link to the right of the document. This will allow you to preview what the document will look like when populated with child, caregiver, and program data. But the download preview will only provide you with fake data. You would need to generate this document as part of a packet in order to have it populate with information from your program. 10.6.1.3 Program Documents Program documents are any documents created by the Program Administrator, and can be downloaded by all users in your program. (For more information on creating a program document, see Section 9.6.2 Creating Documents .) To download a program document: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Documents Quick Link. Locate the program document you would like to download. (You can easily narrow down your search to only program documents by selecting &ldquo;Program&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Document Type&rdquo; drop-down menu.)

NOTE: If the document includes dynamic content, it will have a Download Preview link to the right of the document. This will allow you to preview what the document will look like when populated with child, caregiver, and program data. But the download preview will only provide you with fake data. You would need to generate this document as part of a packet in order to have it populate with information from your program. 10.6.2 Creating Documents As Program Administrator, you have the ability to create documents that are specific to your program. Once you have created a program document, all users in your program will be able to view and download the document.

This document will now be included on the View/Print documents page and will be listed as a Program document. You can add this document to any program packet that you have created. 10.6.2.1 Dynamic Content Dynamic content is coding that allows you to create documents that can be easily populated with data that already exists within your ASQ Online program. For instance, if you want to send a letter to all caregivers in your program, but you wish to personalize it to each caregiver, you can use the dynamic content to do so, without having to individually type in each caregiver&rsquo;s name. Dynamic content can be accessed through the Create Document page. To view the dynamic content available to you, click the icon of the baby, within the &ldquo;Content&rdquo; field on the Create Document page. A drop-down menu will appear with a list of all the dynamic content you can use. To add dynamic content, select the listed item from the drop-down menu that you wish to enter into your document.

How does ASQ-3 involve parents? ASQ-3 relies on parents to observe their child, and to complete the simple questionnaires about their child&rsquo;s abilities. Having parents complete the developmental questionnaires is not only cost effective, but also enhances the accuracy of screening, by tapping into parents&rsquo; in-depth knowledge of their children. Using parent-completed tools also fulfills the spirit of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) amendments, which call for parents to be partners in their child&rsquo;s assessment and intervention activities.

Each report has its own set of criteria that can be narrowed down to include the information most relevant to your report. These criteria are listed on the report generation page of each report as fields or drop-down menus. You will have the option to include child profile fields and child custom fields for many of the screening reports. Please note that if the Include child profile fields option is selected, you will not have the Download PDF option as it compromises the formatting. You will still have the option to Download as a CSV and/or Preview. Leaving a field or drop-down menu blank, prior to generating a report, indicates that you would like to see all data pertaining to that field. For example: If you leave the Providers field blank when generating a report, the report you generate will include data associated with all Providers in your program. (NOTE: If you run a report and see &ldquo;NO PROVIDER&rdquo; listed in the report - that indicates that the Provider who conducted the screening for that child is no longer assigned to that child as their Provider.)

You will still have access to the Finalized ASQ:SE questionnaires in ASQ Online, and you will still be able to run reports on all of your ASQ:SE data. After December 2016, you will lose the ability to enter in any ASQ:SE questionnaires and will no longer have access to any ASQ:SE documents within the Screening Management section of ASQ Online.

You can insert a hyperlink or website address into the program address, welcome message, consent paragraph, and thank you message fields on your Family Access landing page, that caregivers can click on to be directed to a website of your choosing. A hyperlink is text that, when clicked, directs you to a webpage. An example of a hyperlink would be: &ldquo;Click here to return to our program&rsquo;s main page.&rdquo; When the caregiver clicks that line of text, they are directed to the program&rsquo;s main page.

Within the field you wish to insert the hyperlink, type the text that you want the hyperlink to have. Highlight the text and click the link [] icon.

How many keycodes do I need?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; ASQ Online &gt; 14. How many keycodes do I need? 14. How many keycodes do I need? If you are purchasing an ASQ Pro subscription (online data management for a single-site organization), you need one keycode for each type of questionnaire you are interested in using in the online system. For example, if your organization would like to use ASQ-3 in English and ASQ:SE-2 in Spanish, you will need one ASQ-3 English keycode, and one ASQ:SE-2 Spanish keycode. Therefore, your program would need to purchase one box of ASQ-3 English questionnaires and one box of ASQ:SE-2 Spanish questionnaires. The different language editions are separate purchases. If you are purchasing an ASQ Enterprise subscription (online data management for a multi-site organization), each program (site) in your account will need one keycode for each type of questionnaire your organization would like to use in the system. For example, if your ASQ Enterprise account will have four programs (e.g. East, West, North, and South) and you would like to use ASQ-3 English and ASQ:SE-2 English questionnaires with all four programs, you will need eight unique keycodes (four ASQ-3 English keycodes and four ASQ:SE-2 English keycodes). Therefore, your organization would need to purchase four boxes of ASQ-3 English questionnaires and four boxes of ASQ:SE-2 English questionnaires. The different language editions are separate purchases. See also 1. What is ASQ Online? 2. How does an ASQ Online subscription work? 3. What is the difference between ASQ Pro and ASQ Enterprise? 4.

Your Family Access page looks slightly different due to some upgrades and changes made to the ASQ Online system. If you click the link &ldquo;You have [#] family access screenings to approve (or reject)&rdquo; you will no longer see the page with the list of children with a link to review the screening next to each child. Instead, you will be taken to a list of all screenings that have come in through Family Access. Each child has their own drop-down box that includes their name, the caregiver, the questionnaire, the screened date, and the completed date. If you click the Preview link, you can view the demographic data as well as the number of items that were answered for each area. Click the arrow icon to the left of the child&rsquo;s name to bring up the accept/reject options. See also 1. What is dynamic content? 2.

How does an ASQ Online subscription work?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; ASQ Online &gt; 2. How does an ASQ Online subscription work? 2. How does an ASQ Online subscription work? A subscription to ASQ Pro, ASQ Enterprise, or ASQ Family Access is purchased on an annual basis. Programs are eligible to purchase an online subscription after they have purchased the ASQ-3 or ASQ:SE questionnaires. In addition to the annual subscription, programs are charged on a quarterly basis for screening usage. Each completed ASQ-3 or ASQ:SE questionnaire, scored by ASQ Pro or ASQ Enterprise, is counted as a screen. New ASQ Pro and ASQ Enterprise accounts come with a predetermined number of free screens. Once a program uses its allocated free screens, the per-screen fee is a sliding scale starting at $0.50 per screen, and decreasing as screening usage increases. Programs may choose to be billed on a quarterly basis, or to prepay for screens. See also 1. What is ASQ Online? 3. What is the difference between ASQ Pro and ASQ Enterprise? 4. What is ASQ Hub? 5.

My practice/office uses an electronic medical record/electronic health record (EMR/EHR). Can I incorporate ASQ-3 in our EMR/EHR?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; General FAQ &gt; 2. My practice/office uses an electronic medical record/electronic health record (EMR/EHR). Can I incorporate ASQ-3 in our EMR/EHR? 2. My practice/office uses an electronic medical record/electronic health record (EMR/EHR). Can I incorporate ASQ-3 in our EMR/EHR? Some uses of ASQ-3 within an EMR/EHR are permitted without explicit permission from Brookes Publishing. These uses are also in compliance with the ASQ-3 Photocopying Release and the End User License Agreement for the ASQ-3 CD-ROM. Any use not described below requires permission from Brookes Publishing. (To contact the Subsidiary Rights Department, go to www.agesandstages.com/ or email rights@brookespublishing.com) If your practice/office uses a paper questionnaire, asks the parent to complete it, and then enters only the child&rsquo;s scores into the EMR/EHR, that would not require any permission from Brookes Publishing. If the practice/office&rsquo;s EMR/EHR has fields that identify the ASQ-3 questions by number only (not including the text of each question), along with spaces to indicate what the parent has marked for the answers, that would not require any permission from Brookes Publishing. If the practice/office scans a completed ASQ-3 questionnaire (and/or completed Information Summary Sheet) into the EMR/EHR, that would not require any permission from Brookes Publishing, as long as that completed questionnaire is not interactive and not modifiable. This is the equivalent of a practice photocopying a completed ASQ-3 questionnaire to give to the parent to take home, to keep for his or her records. See also 1. What Is ASQ? 3.

What are the psychometric/technical properties of ASQ:SE-2?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; ASQ:SE-2 &gt; 23. What are the psychometric/technical properties of ASQ:SE-2? 23. What are the psychometric/technical properties of ASQ:SE-2? Validity, reliability, and utility studies were conducted on ASQ:SE-2 between 2009 and 2011 to accurately determine the psychometric properties of the screening instrument. Normative studies included 14,074 children, ages 1 month up to 72 months. The results support the ability of ASQ:SE-2 to discriminate between children with social-emotional delays and those who appear to be developing typically in social-emotional areas. Internal consistency, measured by Cronbach&rsquo;s coefficient alpha, ranged from 71%&ndash;91%, indicating strong relationships between questionnaire total scores and individual items. Test-retest reliability, measured as the agreement between two ASQ:SE questionnaires completed by parents at 1- to 3-week intervals, was 89%. These results suggest that ASQ:SE scores were stable across time intervals. Concurrent validity, as reported in percentage agreement between ASQ:SE and concurrent measures, ranged from 71% to 90%, with an overall agreement of 84%. Sensitivity, or the ability of the screening tool to identify those children with social-emotional disabilities, 78% at 2 months to 84% at 24 months, with 81% overall sensitivity. Specificity, or the ability of the screening tool to correctly identify those children without social-emotional delays, ranged from 76% at 18 months to 98% at 60 months with 83% overall specificity.

How does ASQ:SE-2 involve parents?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; General FAQ &gt; 33. How does ASQ:SE-2 involve parents? 33. How does ASQ:SE-2 involve parents? ASQ:SE-2 relies on parents to observe their child, and to complete the simple questionnaires about their child&rsquo;s abilities. Having parents complete the social-emotional questionnaires is not only cost effective, but also enhances the accuracy of screening, by tapping into parents&rsquo; in-depth knowledge of their children. Using parent-completed tools also fulfills the spirit of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) amendments, which call for parents to be partners in their child&rsquo;s assessment and intervention activities.

You can set screening preferences, create program users, create and edit Child Profiles, assign Child Profiles to Providers, enter screening data, create and manage program documents and packets, and generate reports. If you are a Family Access subscriber, you also create your Family Access web page. The Provider role is designed for users such as professionals, employees, or contractors of your organization who work directly with children (e.g., teachers and therapists). Providers have the rights to create and edit Child Profiles; enter child screening data; schedule tasks; generate and download documents and groups of documents; and generate reports. The Reviewer role is designed for users such as program directors and school superintendents, who need to review aggregate reports on children&rsquo;s progress. Reviewers have the ability to generate reports but cannot view, add, edit, or delete specific child records or screenings. 4.2.1 Viewing All Program Users To view a list of all users in your program: 1.

Once a custom field is created, a Provider or Program Administrator will fill out that information when adding or editing a Child or Caregiver Profile. Creating custom fields allows your program to track specific data that you might find useful to report on in the future. NOTE: Only Program Administrators of a Pro account can create custom fields. Custom fields within an Enterprise account are created by the Enterprise Account Administrator. 4.7.1 Adding a Custom Field To add a custom field: Select Program from the top navigation menu.

I understand that use of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 is site specific, but I’m not sure how a “site” is defined. What constitutes a “site?”| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; Costs and Ordering &gt; 5. I understand that use of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 is site specific, but I’m not sure how a “site” is defined. What constitutes a “site?” 5. I understand that use of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 is site specific, but I’m not sure how a “site” is defined. What constitutes a “site?” A site is a single physical location, such as an office. An organization may have various sites--for example, the downtown office, the East branch, and the North branch. The sites may be located in the same city or town, the same county, the same state, or even different states. For instance, the University of Michigan has three campuses in Michigan: Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn. Each campus is a different site; the main campus in Ann Arbor cannot purchase ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 and then share copies of it with the two branch campuses in other cities. Even on one campus, there can be different sites; say, if the School of Social Work wanted to use ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2, and the School of Education also wanted to use ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2, they each must purchase their own ASQ-3 box and ASQ:SE-2 box, as they are separate departments located in different buildings. Head Start programs are another example: Even though there are dozens of Head Start programs across the United States, and they&rsquo;re all part of the same organization, the main office cannot purchase one ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 box to share with all of the sites; each office must own an original ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 box and their corresponding User&rsquo;s Guides . Some ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 users are pediatricians with more than one office in the same town; each office must own an original ASQ-3 and/or ASQ:SE-2 box and their corresponding User&rsquo;s Guides , rather than sharing the ASQ-3/ASQ:SE-2 materials between the multiple offices in the same town.

The Long Form contains all questionnaire items in addition to a Comments section in which a parent&rsquo;s comments can be entered. The answers you enter for each item are automatically converted to their numerical value and automatically totaled according to the ASQ-3 or ASQ:SE-2 scoring logic. To add a screening to a Child Profile, via the Long Form: Select Child Profiles from the top navigation menu. Browse the Child Profiles list or search for a Child Profile. 3. Click on the child&rsquo;s name to access his or her profile. 4. On the Child Profile Details page, click the Add tab, next to the Child Screenings tab. Or, select the Add Screening Quick Link. 5. On the Add Screening page, fill in the following fields: (Items marked with an asterisk [*] are required) a. Caregiver who completed the screening* b. Names of others assisting in screening completion c. Questionnaire type*: ASQ-3, or ASQ:SE-2 ( NOTE: The Questionnaire type drop-down menu will only list the questionnaires that your program has purchased. If you are unable to locate the questionnaire type that is needed to enter in your new questionnaire, please contact your Program Administrator. ) d. Long/Short form*: Select Long form. e. Screening date*: Once this is entered, the Adjusted age, Recommended interval, and Interval will be calculated and automatically entered in the next 3 fields. f. Adjusted age: This field is not editable. g. Recommended interval: This field is not editable. h. Interval*: After reviewing the Adjusted age and Recommended interval, if for any reason you decide to enter an interval other than the one recommended, you may do so here. i. Reason for out of range*: If you select an interval other than the recommended interval, you will be required to record why you are using an interval outside of the recommended range for the child. j. If desired you may add up to a 24 character screening note. This field can also be completed and edited at any time before or after screening is finalized. 6. Click Save. You will be directed to the Long Form for questionnaire results data entry. For ASQ-3, and ASQ:SE-2, notice the tabbed areas across the top of the screen. You can start completing an area by clicking on the tab. 7. For each item, select the button that indicates the caregiver&rsquo;s answer to that item. If the caregiver did not answer the item, select the button for &ldquo;RESPONSE MISSING.&rdquo; 8. If a caregiver wrote a note regarding an item in the questionnaire, you may record this note by clicking the Add-comment icon [ ] to the right of the item. A text box will then appear below the item. Please type the contents of the caregiver&rsquo;s comment into the text box. As you fill out each page, you will notice a score next to each item and, for ASQ-3, an area total score will appear at the bottom of each page. 9. For ASQ-3, when finished answering all items in an area, and for ASQ:SE-2, when finished answering all items on a page, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the right-facing arrow icon [ ] to move to the next set of questions. 10. The page will reload and you will now be on the next tab containing the next set of questions. NOTE: If you click the Save in Progress button instead of the right-facing arrow icon, the page will reload, but you will need to manually click on the next tabbed area to get to the next set of questions. You may click Save in Progress to save what you have entered so far for the screening. Once you click Save in Progress , you may exit out of the screening, and you will find it listed under the Child&rsquo;s Screenings tab marked &ldquo;Incomplete.&rdquo; Click on the name of the questionnaire to resume entering screening results. 11. Continue steps 4 through 7 until you have recorded the caregiver&rsquo;s response to each item on the questionnaire. 12. Once you reach the Overall tab, record all caregiver answers and select the Save in Progress button. The page will then reload and a Finalize button will appear next to the Save in Progress button. 13. To finish the screening and generate the Information Summary Sheet, click the Finalize button. Your program will be charged for this screening. 14. A pop-up window will appear that says &ldquo;You will not be able to alter your answers after you finalize this questionnaire. Do you want to finalize this questionnaire?&rdquo; Click OK to continue. 15. When the questionnaire is finalized, the Information Summary Sheet appears and is listed as the final tab for this screening. From here you may print a copy of the Information Summary Sheet, print the completed questionnaire, print the completed questionnaire with the Information Summary Sheet, add a task, add another screening for the child, or return to the child&rsquo;s profile &ndash; all located under Quick Links. TIP: You are strongly encouraged to enter task for this child after reviewing his or her Information Summary Sheet. The decision you make after reviewing the child&rsquo;s scores and the cutoff scores can be easily recorded as a task that you are then reminded to complete. ASQ Online will provide you with a pop-up reminder to add task for this child, when you are navigating away from the Information Summary page. NOTE: You can still enter screening results for a child even if the child does not have a consent form file. 6.2.2 Adding an ASQ-3 Screening via the Short Form By entering the ASQ-3 screening results for a child via the Short Form, you are choosing to view only the item numbers from the ASQ-3 questionnaire. The Short Form is intended for quick and easy data entry. The answers you select for each item are automatically converted to their numerical value, and automatically totaled according to the ASQ-3 scoring logic. To add an ASQ-3 screening to a Child Profile via the Short Form: 1. Select Child Profiles from the top navigation menu. 2. Browse the Child Profiles list or search for a Child Profile. 3. Click on the child&rsquo;s name to access his or her profile. 4. On the Child Profile Details page, click the Add tab to the right of the Child Screenings tab.

Adjusted age: This field is not editable. g. Recommended interval: This field is not editable. h. Interval*: After reviewing the Adjusted age and Recommended interval, if for any reason you decide to enter an interval other than the one recommended, you may do so here. i.

If desired you may add up to a 24 character screening note. 6. Click Save. You will be directed to the Short Form for questionnaire results data entry. All answers for a screening can be entered into the Short Form on a single web page. 7.

If the caregiver did not answer the item, select &ldquo;X&rdquo; (Response Missing). 8. One main difference between the Short and Long Forms is that the Short Form does not allow you to enter a caregiver comment for each item. Instead, Add-comment icons are only available for those questions where a caregiver or child was instructed to write something on the questionnaire. You may record these notes by clicking the Add- Comment icon [ ] to the right of the item. A text box will then appear below the item. Please type the contents of the caregiver or child&rsquo;s comment into the text box. NOTE: For items that ask a child to draw something in the space provided, please use the comment box to verbally explain the content of the child&rsquo;s drawing. 9. When finished answering all items, click the Save in Progress button. The page will then reload and a Finalize button will appear next to the Save in Progress button. 10. To finish the screening and generate the Information Summary Sheet, click the Finalize button. Your program will be charged for the screening. 11.

NOTE: A score will not appear on the Short Form until the questionnaire is finalized. TIP: You are strongly encouraged to enter a task for this child after reviewing his or her Information Summary Sheet. The decision you make after reviewing the child&rsquo;s scores and the cutoff scores can be easily recorded as a task that you are then reminded to complete. ASQ Online will provide you with a pop-up reminder to add a task for this child, when you are navigating away from the Information Summary page. NOTE: You can still enter screening results for a child even if the child does not have a consent form file. 6.2.3 Adding an ASQ:SE -2 Screening via the Short Form By entering the ASQ:SE/ASQ:SE-2 screening results for a child via the Short Form, you are choosing to view only the item numbers from the ASQ:SE/ASQ:SE-2 questionnaire.

If desired you may add up to a 24 character screening note. 6. Click Save. You will be directed to the Short Form for questionnaire results data entry. All answers for a screening can be entered into the Short Form on a single web page. 7. For each item, select the button that indicates the caregiver&rsquo;s answer to that item (&ldquo;Most Of The Time,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rarely Or Never&rdquo;). If the caregiver did not answer the item, select the button for &ldquo;Response Missing.&rdquo; Put a checkmark in the box under the &ldquo;Concern&rdquo; column if a caregiver indicated concern on a specific question. 8. One main difference between the Short and Long Forms is that the Short Form does not allow you to enter a caregiver comment for each item. Instead, Add-comment icons are only available for those questions where a caregiver or child was instructed to write something on the questionnaire. You may record these notes by clicking the Add- comment icon [ ] to the right of the item. A text box will then appear below the item.

Each report has its own set of criteria that can be narrowed down to include the information most relevant to your report. These criteria are listed on the report generation page of each report as fields or drop-down menus. Leaving a field or drop-down menu blank, prior to generating a report, indicates that you would like to see all data pertaining to that field. For example: If you leave the Providers field blank when generating a report, the report you generate will include data associated with all Providers in your program.

What are the psychometric/technical properties of ASQ:SE-2?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; General FAQ &gt; 66. What are the psychometric/technical properties of ASQ:SE-2? 66. What are the psychometric/technical properties of ASQ:SE-2? Validity, reliability, and utility studies were conducted on ASQ:SE-2 between 2009 and 2011 to accurately determine the psychometric properties of the screening instrument. Normative studies included 14,074 children, ages 1 month up to 72 months. The results support the ability of ASQ:SE-2 to discriminate between children with social-emotional delays and those who appear to be developing typically in social-emotional areas. Internal consistency,measured by Cronbach&rsquo;s coefficient alpha, ranged from 71%&ndash;91%, indicating strong relationships between questionnaire total scores and individual items. Test-retest reliability, measured as the agreement between two ASQ:SE questionnaires completed by parents at 1-to 3-week intervals, was 89%. These results suggest that ASQ:SE scores were stable across time intervals.Concurrent validity, as reported in percentage agreement between ASQ:SE and concurrent measures, ranged from 71% to 90%, with an overall agreement of 84%. Sensitivity, or the ability of the screening tool to identify those children with social-emotional disabilities, 78% at 2 months to 84% at 24 months, with 81% overall sensitivity. Specificity, or the ability of the screening tool to correctly identify those children without social-emotional delays, ranged from 76% at 18 months to 98% at 60 months with 83% overall specificity.

What is a Family Access landing page?| Home &gt; FAQs &gt; Family Access &gt; 7. What is a Family Access landing page? 7. What is a Family Access landing page? The Family Access landing page is the website where caregivers will be directed when accessing the Family Access URL provided to them by your program. It is through the Family Access landing page that caregivers access the ASQ questionnaire online, and enter screening information for children. A Family Access landing page includes the following information: program logo, program address information, welcome message, ASQ-3 or ASQ:SE questionnaire information summary, consent paragraph, and optional footer logos. When a caregiver visits a Family Access landing page, he or she is first asked to enter his or her child&rsquo;s birth date and weeks premature. This will prompt the system to generate the questionnaire for the child&rsquo;s recommended interval. When the caregiver selects the link to enter their child&rsquo;s screening information, they are instructed to enter the child&rsquo;s demographic information and their own demographic information, as well as their relationship to the child. The caregiver then confirms the screening interval they completed for their child and enters the screening results and any notes in the overall section. The caregiver then submits the questionnaire to your program. See also 1. What is dynamic content? 2. Can you provide an example of dynamic content, and how it populates a document? 3.

There are three types of packets for Providers in ASQ Online: System Packets, Program Packets, and My Packets. System packets are packets provided by the ASQ Online system. Program packets are packets that a Program Administrator can create and customize, and can be generated and downloaded by all users in the program. My Packets are packets that only you as a Provider can create, customize, and generate. No other system users will be able to view or generate any packets that you create. 7.5.1 View/Print Packets The View/Print Packets page is where you will go to generate and download packets. Once a packet is generated, its corresponding task will be completed in the system. You can view all children that you have generated a packet for by clicking the Child List link next to the packet. Clicking the View/Print Packets Quick Link on the Screening Management page will take you to a list of all system packets, program packets, and personal packets (&ldquo;My Packets&rdquo;). The first five packets will be listed, including the name of the packet, the questionnaire type (if applicable), and options to view the packet, generate the packet, and view the child list. My Packets will also include options to edit or delete the packets. Use the Next button below the list of packets to scroll through all system, program, and personal packets available. 7.5.2 System Packets System packets are packets provided by the ASQ Online system. These packets include groups of documents to aid you in completing the associated task. You can&rsquo;t edit system packets; if you wish to customize a packet for your children and caregivers, you can create a personal packet (&ldquo;My Packets&rdquo;). Below is a list of the system packets available in ASQ Online, and the documents that are included in each packet: Viewing System Packets You can view the contents of system packets, and preview the documents that make up the packet from the View/Print Packets page. To view system packets: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Packets Quick Link. Under the System Packets section, find the packet that you would like to view. Click the View link to the right of that packet. On the Packet Details page, you can view the documents included in the packet, including the document name, the category (Screening, Follow-up, or Other), and the document type (For system packets, all documents will be system documents). If the document has dynamic content that will automatically populate with program, caregiver, and child information, there will be a Download Preview link to the right of the document. You can click this link to view a sample of what the document will look like when you generate the packet. If the document does not include dynamic content, there will be a Download link to the right of the document. You can click this link to view what the document will look like when you generate the packet. 7.5.3 Program Packets Program Administrators can create customized program packets, which you can generate and download as a Provider. Program packets can include any system documents as well as any program documents created by the Program Administrator. (System documents are documents provided by the ASQ Online system, and program documents are documents that the Program Administrator has created.) Once a program packet is created, it will appear in the Program Packets section on the View/Print Packets page. From there, you can view the packet, generate the packet, and view a list of children for whom the packet has been generated. 7.5.4 My Packets As a Provider, you can create customized packets to generate and download for the children to whom you are assigned. Personal packets can include system documents, program documents, and any personal documents that you have created. (System documents are documents provided by the ASQ Online system, program documents are documents that the Program Administrator has created, and personal documents are documents that you have created.) Once a personal packet is created, it will appear in the My Packets section on the View/Print Packets page. From there, you can view the packet, generate the packet, edit or delete the packet, and view a list of children for whom the packet has been generated. 7.5.4.1 Creating a Packet To create a packet, you will name the packet, and add the documents. You can search for available documents to add to the packet by document name, questionnaire type, category (Screening, Follow-up, or Other), and document type (System, Program, or Personal). To create a personal packet: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the Create Packet Quick Link. Enter a name for the packet in the &ldquo;Packet name&rdquo; field.

Make any desired changes to the packet and then click the Update button. To delete the packet, click the Delete link to the right of the packet. 7.5.5 Generating &amp; Downloading Packets Generating a packet will serve two purposes. First, it will automatically complete the task associated with that packet. Second, it will allow you to download the packet as a PDF file, so that you can print and mail it to the caregiver. To generate a packet: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Click the View/Print Packets Quick Link. Locate the packet you would like to generate and click the Generate link. Locate the child for whom you would like to generate this packet and click the Download link. When the packet has finished generating, click the Download File link. You can then open the PDF file or save it to your computer. When you click the Generate link next to a packet, you will be taken to a page where you select the child or children for whom you would like to generate this packet. You will see four tabs and multiple search fields to assist you in quickly and easily locating the children for whom you are generating the packet. The four tabs are: Screenings Due, Tasks Due, Child Profiles, and Completed Screenings. Once a packet has been generated and downloaded it will be available for a limited time under Recent Bulk Prints via the Quick Links in Screening Management. 7.5.5.1 Generating Packets via the Screenings Due Tab The Screenings Due tab will list all screening tasks that are scheduled to be sent out to caregivers. Once you generate the packet for a child listed under Screenings Due, that task will move to Screening Tasks Completed (a screening task is completed when the packet has been generated). The Screenings Due list includes the due date, the child name, the child DOB, questionnaire, type, previous questionnaire, and previous result. You can easily search through the list of screenings due and narrow it down by using the Search field at the top of the page. You can search by due date, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, type, questionnaire, previous questionnaire, and previous result. To search, begin typing what you are searching for in the corresponding text field and ASQ Online will automatically pull up any results matching your search. When you have located the child for whom you would like to generate this packet, click the Download link to the right of the child&rsquo;s name. The file will run and then a Download File link will appear. Click this link and a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open or save this PDF file. Once you download the packet and refresh the page, ASQ Online will update the Screenings Due list &ndash; the child you have generated the packet for will no longer be listed under Screenings Due. This will help you keep track of which children you still need to generate screening packets for. 7.5.5.2 Generating Packets via the Tasks Due Tab The Tasks Due tab will list all non-screening tasks that are due for completion. Once you generate a packet for a child listed under the Tasks Due tab, the task will move to Tasks Completed (a task is completed when the corresponding packet has been generated). The Tasks Due list includes the due date, the child name, the child DOB, the task type, the previous questionnaire, and the previous result. You can easily search through the list of tasks due and narrow it down by using the Search field at the top of the page. You can search by due date, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, task type, previous questionnaire, and previous result. To search, begin typing what you are searching for in the corresponding text field and ASQ Online will automatically pull up any results matching your search. When you have located the child for whom you would like to generate this packet, click the Download link to the right of the child&rsquo;s name. The file will run and then a Download File link will appear. Click this link and a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open or save this PDF file. If you are generating a packet that includes screening documents, you have the option to customize the interval. If the packet includes screening documents (such as a questionnaire), you will see a Customize link to the right of the child. Clicking this link will pull up a pop-up box, which includes the recommended interval. If you would like to use the recommended interval in order to generate a blank questionnaire for the next screening for the child, click the Use Interval button. If you would like to generate the packet with a screening that has already been completed for the child, you can select the interval (including the date the child was screened) from the &ldquo;Completed Screening&rdquo; drop-down menu, and click the Use Screening button. The packet will then generate with the completed screening for that child. Once you download the packet and refresh the page, ASQ Online will update the Tasks Due list &ndash; the child you have generated the packet for will no longer be listed under Tasks Due. This will help you keep track of which children you still need to generate task packets for. 7.5.5.3 Generating Packets via the Child Profiles Tab The Child Profiles tab will list all of the Child Profiles to which you are assigned. This tab will allow you to generate a packet for a child who doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have a screening or non-screening task scheduled for completion. The Child Profiles tab lists the child name, the child DOB, the previous questionnaire, the previous result of that questionnaire, and the date the questionnaire was last sent. You can search for specific children by date last sent, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, previous questionnaire, and previous result. You can also choose to search for only those children that have not had materials sent to them. If you are generating a packet that includes screening documents, you have the option to customize the interval. If the packet includes screening documents (such as a questionnaire), you will see a Customize link to the right of the child. Clicking this link will pull up a pop-up box, which includes the recommended interval. If you would like to use the recommended interval in order to generate a blank questionnaire for this child&rsquo;s screening, click the Use Interval button. If you would like to generate the packet with a different screening interval, you can select that interval from the drop-down menu and click the Use Interval button. Once you generate the packet and download the file, the date in the &ldquo;Date Last Sent&rdquo; column will update with the date you generated the packet. 7.5.5.4 Generating Packets via the Completed Screenings Tab The Completed Screenings tab will list all completed screenings of all of your assigned children, regardless of whether they had associated tasks. You can use this tab to download a screening packet that includes the completed questionnaire. ( NOTE: The completed questionnaire will only be attached to a related screening packet that includes a questionnaire document.) The Completed Screenings tab lists the screening date, the child name, the child DOB, the questionnaire, the result (Above, Monitoring, or Below), and the date the materials were last sent to the caregiver. You can search for specific children by date last sent, screening date, child DOB, child name, child ID, child alt. ID, questionnaire, and result. You can also choose to search for only those children that have not had materials sent to them. Once you generate the packet and download the file, the date in the &ldquo;Date Last Sent&rdquo; column will update with the date you generated the packet. 7.5.6 Viewing the Child List If you wish to see a list of all children for whom you have generated a packet, you can click the Child List link to the right of that packet. The Child List page will show you each child for whom that packet has been generated, the child&rsquo;s date of birth, and the date the packet was generated for that child. You can also search for specific children by date generated, child DOB, child name, child ID, and child alt. ID. To view a packet&rsquo;s Child List: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Packets Quick Link. Locate the system, program, or personal packet with the child list you would like to view. Click the Child List link to the right of the packet.

These documents include the forms found in the ASQ User&rsquo;s Guides, as well as other system documents, program documents that the Program Administrator has created, and personal documents that you have created as a Provider. Documents are what make up packets, but you can also download and print any document on its own, without generating a packet. There are 3 categories of documents: Screening, Follow-up, and Other. Screening documents are all documents that are associated with the screening of children. Follow-up documents are all documents intended to be used when following up on a screening with the child&rsquo;s caregiver. And Other documents are additional documents that don&rsquo;t fall into either Screening or Follow-up categories, but are still helpful to your program. Below is a table listing all of the documents provided by ASQ Online, and which category they fall under. 7.6.1 View/Print Documents The View/Print Documents page lists all the system, program, and personal documents, in alphabetical order. The documents list includes the name, description of the document (for program and personal documents only), the questionnaire type associated with the document (if applicable), the category (Screening, Follow-up, or Other), and the document type (System, Program, or Personal). Each document will also include a Download link, so that you can generate the document as a PDF file and print it or save it to your computer. Any documents that contain dynamic content will have a Download Preview link to the right of the document. Clicking this will allow you to see what the document will look like when it is generated with child, caregiver, or program information within a packet, by using fake data as an example. (For more information on dynamic content, see Section 7.6.2.1 Dynamic Content .) To access the View/Print Documents page: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Documents Quick Link. 7.6.1.1 Searching for Documents You can quickly and easily search for any document by using the Search Documents field at the top of the View/Print Documents page. You can search by the name of the document, the description of the document (for program and personal documents only), the questionnaire type, the category, and the document type. To search for a document, begin typing in the corresponding field, or select an option from the drop-down menu, and ASQ Online will automatically pull up suggestions matching your search options. 7.6.1.2 System Documents System documents are all documents provided by the ASQ Online system, including screening and follow-up documents. To download a system document: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Documents Quick Link. Locate the system document you would like to download. (You can easily narrow down your search to only system documents by selecting &ldquo;System&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Document Type&rdquo; drop-down menu.) Click the Download link to the right of the document. A pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open the PDF file or save it to your computer. NOTE: If the document includes dynamic content, it will have a Download Preview link to the right of the document. This will allow you to preview what the document will look like when populated with child, caregiver, and program data. But the download preview will only provide you with fake data. You would need to generate this document as part of a packet in order to have it populate with information from your program. 7.6.1.3 Program Documents Program documents are any documents created by the Program Administrator, and can be downloaded by all users in the program. To download a program document: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the View/Print Documents Quick Link. Locate the program document you would like to download. (You can easily narrow down your search to only program documents by selecting &ldquo;Program&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Document Type&rdquo; drop-down menu.) Click the Download link to the right of the document. A pop-up window will appear and you can choose to open the PDF file or save it to your computer. NOTE: If the document includes dynamic content, it will have a Download Preview link to the right of the document. This will allow you to preview what the document will look like when populated with child, caregiver, and program data. But the download preview will only provide you with fake data. You would need to generate this document as part of a packet in order to have it populate with information from your program. 7.6.1.4 Personal Documents Personal documents are any documents that you have created as a Provider. You are the only user in the system that will be able to view and download your personal documents. To download a personal document: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu.

You would need to generate this document as part of a packet in order to have it populate with information from your program. 7.6.2 Creating Documents As a Provider, you can create your own documents that you can print or attach to any personal packets. Any documents that you create cannot be viewed or downloaded by anyone else in the system; you are the only user with access to your personal documents. To create a personal document: Select Screening Management from the top navigation menu. Select the Create Document Quick Link. Enter the title of your document in the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; field. Enter an optional description of this document in the &ldquo;Description&rdquo; field. Select the document category from the drop-down menu. Your options are Screening, Follow-up, or Other.

This document will now be included on the View/Print documents page and will be listed as a Personal document. You can add this document to any personal packet that you have created. 7.6.2.1 Dynamic Content Dynamic content is coding that allows you to create documents that can be easily populated with data that already exists within your ASQ Online program. For instance, if you want to send a letter to all caregivers, but you wish to personalize it to each caregiver, you can use the dynamic content to do so, without having to individually type in each caregiver&rsquo;s name. Dynamic content can be accessed through the Create Document page. To view the dynamic content available to you, click the icon of the baby, within the &ldquo;Content&rdquo; field on the Create Document page. A drop-down menu will appear with a list of all the dynamic content you can use. To add dynamic content, select the listed item from the drop-down menu that you wish to enter into your document. The dynamic content will appear in the &ldquo;Content&rdquo; field as code. Continue typing around the code as if the code were the actual content that will be pulled from ASQ Online.

Family Access allows programs to create websites where they can direct caregivers to complete screenings for their children online. Once accepted by you, the screens that were entered via Family Access automatically become part of your program screens. There is no additional data entry necessary to enter screening results. As a Provider, you will be using Family Access to solicit screenings from children already in your program, to whom you are already assigned. You might also use Family Access to easily add children who are a part of your program but not yet in the ASQ Online system.

For this reason, you don&rsquo;t want anyone not a part of your program using your Family Access landing page to enter screenings. To ensure that only caregivers whose children are part of your program have access to your Family Access landing page, you can provide them with a passcode that must be entered in order for them to access the questionnaires. If you choose to provide a passcode, your Family Access landing page will have an additional field that prompts the caregiver to enter the passcode before continuing.

If you have provided a passcode, the caregivers will also be instructed to enter that passcode in order to access the questionnaires. Once this information is entered, Family Access will generate the correct screening interval for the child and instruct the caregiver to print out a blank copy of the questionnaire to fill out with the child over the next week. It will also instruct the caregiver to return to the Family Access landing page to enter the information collected on the questionnaire for the child. When the caregiver selects the link to enter their child&rsquo;s screening information, they are instructed to enter the child&rsquo;s demographic information and their own demographic information, as well as their relationship to the child. The caregiver then enters the screening results and any notes that he or she may have recorded on the printed questionnaire into the online questionnaire. When finished, the caregiver clicks Submit and is directed to a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; page.

The online management system that is ASQ Online helps you capture and perform a process. The central part of this process is conducting an ASQ screening. ASQ Online helps you prepare for and conduct a screening, gives you access to resources you can use to interpret the screening results and make a follow-up decision, and allows you to schedule follow-up tasks (including sending results to parents or physicians and scheduling another screening in the appropriate time frame). By using the system to its fullest potential, the screening and referral process becomes seamless, and you are left with an electronic record of all actions you&rsquo;ve taken and decisions you&rsquo;ve made pertaining to any one child or group of children in your program. The ASQ Online management process is a circular one. The decisions you would typically make when using ASQ on paper are the same decisions you should make when working within ASQ Online. Your professional judgment should guide your actions. The online management system simply aids in the screening process, helping you keep track of information and reminding you to complete important tasks. Once you have set up your program, you can manage your program through the following sections of ASQ Online: Screenings : Easily manage all screenings in your program through one central page. Screening Management : Schedule screening and non-screening tasks, generate materials, and keep track of the tasks within your program. Family Access : Have caregivers complete questionnaires online. (This is an additional subscription.) Reports : Generate and review to interpret screening results and decide on appropriate follow-up actions or tasks.

Each report has its own set of criteria that can be narrowed down to include the information most relevant to your report. These criteria are listed on the report generation page of each report as fields or drop-down menus. You will have the option to include child profile fields and child custom fields. Please note that if one of these options is selected you will only be able to download a csv file or preview the report. Leaving a field or drop-down menu blank, prior to generating a report, indicates that you would like to see all data pertaining to that field. For example: If you leave the Providers field blank when generating a report, the report you generate will include data associated with all Providers in your account or in a program. Keep in mind that some fields are dependent on other fields when generating a report. In order to generate a report for a specific Provider for instance, you must first specify a program. (NOTE: If you run a report and see &ldquo;NO PROVIDER&rdquo; listed in the report, that indicates that the Provider who conducted the screening for that child is no longer assigned to that child as their Provider.)
